# The purpose of this prosject

This web aplication will be an all in one progress tracker for your life. Hopefully i will have systems for exercise, studies, work, personal prosject, habits, and ofcoure a simple to-do list. And hopfully much more.
The project is not intended to have all the functionalities that other apps for each and one spesific area of your life mentioned above. But it will have all the information in one place, and can therfor help you use your time more productively and wisely by your own definition.
The main usecase for this app can then be sumorised as something like this: **Help you keep track of what you spend time on, and plan how to spend your time more wisely**

The other reason I am building this prosject, is so I can leran the MERN stack - wich I am using to build this prosject -, to further develope my knowlage and abilitys in web developement.

At this time I dont know when I am going to put the prosject onlie. But if you are interestes, pleass contact me. I would really like to interact with some other aspiering developers.
